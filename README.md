## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
ReguBIM AI is built on Databricks' scalable architecture, utilizing a medallion pattern for efficient data management. The system automates data processing through ETL pipelines triggered by file arrivals, transforming both BIM models and regulatory documents from raw data to analysis-ready formats. The application is deployed as a Databricks App, leveraging Databricks' serverless infrastructure.

## üåü Features

ReguBIM AI processes user queries through different chains:

</div>

1. **Building Codes & Regulations Analysis**
   <div align="left">
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604f28a5-9470-4cde-adb8-a0e1b95d6cd6" width="650" alt="Code and Regulation RAG Chain">
   </div>
* Converts regulatory documents into searchable vector embeddings
* Uses transformer models for semantic understanding
* Uses RAG to analyze and retrieve relevant building codes
* Employs re-ranking to ensure most relevant regulations are retrieved
* Sample queries:
   * "What are the code and regulations for FCC?" 
   * "What are FCC Room Requirements I have to comply with?"

2. **BIM Data Spatial Analysis**
   <div align="left">

   </div>
* Uses ReAct agent for spatial analysis and graph-based exploration
* Performs pathfinding and spatial relationship analysis using NetworkX
* Creates Room Connectivity Graphs for spatial relationship analysis
* Calculates distances using Manhattan distance for realistic measurements
* Sample queries:
   * "How many rooms are there and can you list all the rooms?"
   * "What is the path from FCC to Staircase?"

3. **Automated Compliance Checks**
   <div align="left">
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/346078ae-abc4-4a10-9cb4-fc49a22c3967" width="650" alt="Code and Regulation RAG Chain">
   </div>
* Cross-references BIM data against regulations for compliance verification
* Integrates both regulatory requirements and spatial analysis
* Generates detailed compliance reports with recommendations
* Identifies specific violations and suggests corrections
* Sample queries:
   * "Does the FCC comply with codes and regulations?"

Additionally, ReguBIM AI includes a **General Response Chain** for handling basic interactions and queries:
* Processes general inquiries and conversational interactions
* Provides helpful guidance to users
* Example: "Hello, can you help me?"

### üí° How Queries Are Processed

When you input a query, ReguBIM AI classifies and processes it through the appropriate chain. Here are some examples:

| Query | Classification | Explanation |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| "Hello, can you help me?" | General Response Chain | Basic greeting and assistance request |
| "How many rooms are there and can you list all the rooms?" | BIM Revit Data Chain | Requests spatial information from BIM data |
| "What are FCC Room Requirements I have to comply with?" | Code and Regulation RAG Chain | Seeks regulatory information about FCC requirements |
| "What is the path from FCC to Staircase?" | BIM Revit Data Chain | Requests pathfinding analysis between spaces |
| "Does the FCC comply with code and regulation?" | Compliance Check Chain | Requests comprehensive compliance verification |
